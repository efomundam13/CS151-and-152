1.
(a) The three Hunger Games novels contain a total of 301,583 words (99,750 for Hunger
Games, 101,564 for Catching Fire, and 100,269 for Mockingjay – yes, someone counted
them). If we assume 4.79 letters per words plus 1.21 extra characters per word (for
space after the word, punctuation, etc) this gives a total of 1,809,498 characters. If
these characters are stored in a computer using Unicode, how many megabytes would
this take? How many copies of all three volumes could you store on a 100 GB hard
drive? (NOTE: Each characters in Unicode uses 16 bits and 1 byte = 8 bits).

1,809,498 characters * 2 bytes/character = 3,619,996 bytes
3,619,996 bytes / 1024 bytes/kB = 3530.72 kB
3530.72 kB / 1024 kB/MB = 3.42 MB
Therefore, all three volumes of the Hunger Games novels would take up 3.42 MB of storage if stored in Unicode.
A 100 GB hard drive can store 100,000,000,000 bytes, or 100,000 MB. Therefore, you could store 294,117 copies of all three volumes of the Hunger Games novels on a 100 GB hard drive.

(b) Computers use an internal clock which sends out a steady set of pulses called cycles.
The speed of these clocks are measured in gigahertz (GHz) where 1 GHz = one billion
cycles per second. If we assume that on average a machine instruction takes two clock
cycles, how many instructions can be executed in one minute on a 3.3 GHz machine?

A 3.3 GHz machine can execute 3,300,000,000 cycles per second. If each machine instruction takes two clock cycles, then a 3.3 GHz machine can execute 1,650,000,000 instructions per second.

(c) How long (to the nearest year) would it take a person to execute the same number of
instructions in part b) if they perform one instruction per sec?

If a person performs one instruction per second, then it would take them 1,650,000,000 seconds to execute the same number of instructions as a 3.3 GHz machine can execute in one minute. This is equal to 27,397.2 hours, or 1141.5 days, or 3.14 years.

2.Convert the following binary numbers to base-10. Show your work (on this and
all subsequent problems).
a) 1012 b) 1111112 c) 110111112 d) 111101101002

a) 1012 = 510

b) 1111112 = 31

c) 110111112 = 25510

d) 111101101002 = 21710

3. Convert the binary numbers in the previous problem to hexadecimal.

a) 1012 = 510 = 5

b) 1111112 = 3110 = 1F16

c) 110111112 = 25510 = FF16

d) 111101101002 = 21710 = D716

4. For each binary number in problem 2 find the closest base-10 number who’s binary
representation uses only three 1’s (like 101102 or 100010000012).

a) The closest base-10 number whose binary representation uses only three 1's is 8. The binary representation of 8 is 10002, which has three 1's.

b) The closest base-10 number whose binary representation uses only three 1's is 31. The binary representation of 31 is 1111112, which has four 1's. The closest binary representation with only three 1's is 1112, which is equal to 7.

c) The closest base-10 number whose binary representation uses only three 1's is 255. The binary representation of 255 is 111111112, which has eight 1's. The closest binary representation with only three 1's is 11112, which is equal to 31.

d) The closest base-10 number whose binary representation uses only three 1's is 217. The binary representation of 217 is 111101101002, which has ten 1's. The closest binary representation with only three 1's is 11102, which is equal to 14.

5. Take the last four digits of your phone number and convert it to binary and hexadecimal. Recall that one way to convert it to binary is to find the largest power of 2
which is less than your number, subtract this power of 2 from your number, and then repeat
this procedure with the remainder

Sure, here is the binary representation of 2852:
101100100100_2
​
Here is the hexadecimal representation of 2852:
D7C_16

6.Give the hexadecimal, binary and base-10 values for the following Unicode character(Hint: it’s Kannada-ian)

Unicode value	Hexadecimal value	Binary value	Decimal value
U+0C28			0C28				1100001010000	304
