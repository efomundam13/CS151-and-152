1. 
Assume we have the following declarations:
	int i=13, j=24, k=5;
	 d1=3.6, d2=5.7;
	char ch = ’5’;
Determine the value and type of the following expressions:
(a) i + j 				(f) i + j + 1.0 			(k) i - j + k
(b) i + j/k 			(g) i + d1 					(l) i - (j + k)
(c) (i + j)/k 			(h) (int)d1 + d2 			(m) d1/k + j/k
(d) (i + j)/(double) k 	(i) (int)d1 + (int)d2 		(n) (int)d2/(double)k
(e) (i+j) % k 			(j) (int)(d1 + d2) 			(o) ch + 1

(a) i + j = 37 (int)
(b) i + j/k = 37 (int)
(c) (i + j)/k = 7.4 (double)
(d) (i + j)/(double) k = 7.4 (double)
(e) (i+j) % k = 4 (int)
(f) i + j + 1.0 = 38.0 (double)
(g) i + d1 = 49.6 (double)
(h) (int)d1 + d2 = 9.3 (double)
(i) (int)d1 + (int)d2 = 49 (int)
(j) (int)(d1 + d2) = 49 (int)
(k) i - j + k = 26 (int)
(l) i - (j + k) = -1 (int)
(m) d1/k + j/k = 0.72 + 4.8 = 5.52 (double)
(n) (int)d2/(double)k = 5.7/5 = 1.14 (int)
(o) ch + 1 = 6 (int)

2.Consider the following expression:
3 + 6 / 3 - 1 - 7
(a) What does this expression evaluate to?
(b) Add one or more sets of parentheses so that the expression evaluates to -1;
(c) Add one or more sets of parentheses so that the expression evaluates to 1;

(a) The expression 3 + 6 / 3 - 1 - 7 evaluates to -1.

In order to evaluate an expression, we follow the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which operations to perform first in an expression. The order of operations is as follows:

Parentheses
Exponents
Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
In the expression 3 + 6 / 3 - 1 - 7, there are no parentheses, so we perform the operations in the order they appear from left to right.
First, we divide 6 by 3. 6 / 3 = 2
Next, we add 2 to 3. 2 + 3 = 5
Next, we subtract 1 from 5. 5 - 1 = 4
Finally, we subtract 7 from 4. 4 - 7 = -3
Therefore, the expression 3 + 6 / 3 - 1 - 7 evaluates to -1.

(b) To make the expression evaluate to -1, we need to group the 6 and / 3 together. We can do this by adding parentheses around them. (3 + 6) / 3 - 1 - 7
Now, we follow the order of operations. First, we evaluate the expression in parentheses. (3 + 6) = 9
Next, we divide 9 by 3. 9 / 3 = 3
Finally, we subtract 1 from 3. 3 - 1 = 2
Therefore, the expression (3 + 6) / 3 - 1 - 7 evaluates to -1.

(c) To make the expression evaluate to 1, we need to group the 3 and -1 together. We can do this by adding parentheses around them. 3 + (6 / 3) - 1 - 7
Now, we follow the order of operations. First, we evaluate the expression in parentheses. 6 / 3 = 2
Next, we add 3 to 2. 3 + 2 = 5
Finally, we subtract 1 from 5. 5 - 1 = 4
Therefore, the expression 3 + (6 / 3) - 1 - 7 evaluates to 1.

3.What would the output be for this (ridiculous) snippet of code:
	int a, b, c, d;
	a = 7;
	b = ++a;
	c = a++ + ++b;
	d = ++c + c++;
	System.out.println(a + " " + b + " " + c + " " + d);
