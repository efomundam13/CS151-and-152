/*
4. The file presidents.txt is a text file that contains each presidentâ€™s name on one
line followed by three integers on the next line indicating the month, day and year of their
birth (you can look at the file using a text editor to get a better idea of its layout). Write a
program that asks the user for a month, then opens this file and outputs all of the presidents
born on that month to both the screen and to another file. This new file should be called
presidents<n>.txt where <n> is the number of the month entered (for example, if 6 was
entered for the month, then you should output the results to a file names presidents6.txt.
